Create the data model for a restaurant chain database according to the following information:

Organization has restaurant chain (of which you want to store address, city, country, restaurant name and branch phone numbers (operator, kitchen, accounting). Each restaurant has seating tables with different seat count and types. Chain has flagship restaurant. 
Restaurant clients are registered in restaurant database by operators while caller is making reservation. Information about operator contains name, surname, person identification number, personal phone number, branch where he is sitting (physically working) and restaurant for which he is making reservations. Client data could contain information about client name, surname, phone number and operator comment (discounts, allergens, etc.). Reservation can be made by everyone who call to restaurant operator (do not need store information about calls). While operator is creating reservation, he is asking name, phone number, restaurant name (address), seating information, date, time and offers caller became as client. Operator can add comment about reservation.
